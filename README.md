# Pong-Game
Pong is a classic arcade game from the 1970s where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The ultimate goal is to score points by making the ball pass the opponentâ€™s paddle. The game features simple graphics and gameplay, but it offers engaging, fast-paced action as players delve into competitive matches.
